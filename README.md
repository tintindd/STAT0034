# STAT0034
This section contains all the code used to generate the contents of the STAT0034 report. The functionality of each file is described as follows:

1.skeletonization_2D.py: performs two-dimensional skeleton extraction. 

2.graph_2D.py: extracts simplified 2D graphs and cycles, and visualizes the cycle length distribution.  

3.wasserstein_distance.py:computes the differences in overall cycle length distributions across datasets.  

4.cycle_position_2Dto3D.py: maps two-dimensional cycle information into three-dimensional space.  

5.skeletonization_graph_3D.py: extracts three-dimensional skeletons and simplified graphs, while also generating statistics such as the number of nodes and edge lengths.

6.figire_example.py: generates the horse skeleton figure and the 26-neighbourhood reference diagram.
